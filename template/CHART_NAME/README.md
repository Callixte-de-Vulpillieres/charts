```

## Introduction

%%INTRODUCTION%% (check existing examples)

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%
```

The command deploys %%CHART_NAME%% on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

See https://github.com/bitnami-labs/readme-generator-for-helm to create the table

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set %%CHART_NAME%%Username=admin \
  --set %%CHART_NAME%%Password=password \
  --set mariadb.auth.rootPassword=secretpassword \
    bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%
```

The above command sets the %%CHART_NAME%% administrator account username and password to `admin` and `password` respectively. Additionally, it sets the MariaDB `root` user password to `secretpassword`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Use an external database

%%IF NEEDED%%

Sometimes, you may want to have the chart use an external database rather than using the one bundled with the chart. Common use cases include using a managed database service, or using a single database server for all your applications. This chart supports external databases through its `externalDatabase.*` parameters.

When using these parameters, it is necessary to disable installation of the bundled MariaDB database using the `mariadb.enabled=false` parameter.

> NOTE: If disabling the bundled database server as described above, it is mandatory to supply values for the `externalDatabase.*` parameters.

An example of the parameters set when deploying the chart with an external database are shown below:
```
mariadb.enabled=false
externalDatabase.host=myexternalhost
externalDatabase.user=myuser
externalDatabase.password=mypassword
externalDatabase.database=mydatabase
externalDatabase.port=3306
```

### Ingress

%%IF NEEDED%%

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your application.

To enable Ingress integration, set `ingress.enabled` to `true`. The `ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host. It is also possible to have more than one host, with a separate TLS configuration for each host.

In general, to enable Ingress integration, set the `*.ingress.enabled` parameter to *true*.

The most common scenario is to have one host name mapped to the deployment. In this case, the `*.ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `*.ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host.

However, it is also possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the `*.ingress.extraHosts` parameter (if available) can be set with the host names specified as an array. The `*.ingress.extraTLS` parameter (if available) can also be used to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts.

> NOTE: For each host specified in the `*.ingress.extraHosts` parameter, it is necessary to set a name, path, and any annotations that the Ingress controller should know about. Not all annotations are supported by all Ingress controllers, but [this annotation reference document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md) lists the annotations supported by many popular Ingress controllers.

Adding the TLS parameter (where available) will cause the chart to generate HTTPS URLs, and the  application will be available on port 443. The actual TLS secrets do not have to be generated by this chart. However, if TLS is enabled, the Ingress record will not work until the TLS secret exists.

[Learn more about Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

### Enable TLS

TLS support can be enabled in the chart by specifying the `tls.` parameters while creating a release. The following parameters should be configured to properly enable the TLS support in the chart:

- `tls.enabled`: Enable TLS support. Defaults to false
- `tls.certificatesSecret`: Name of the secret that contains the certificates. No defaults.
- `tls.certFilename`: Certificate filename. No defaults.
- `tls.certKeyFilename`: Certificate key filename. No defaults.
- `tls.certCAFilename`: CA Certificate filename. No defaults.

For example:

- Create the secret with the certificate files:
```console
$ kubectl create secret generic certificates-tls-secret --from-file=./cert.pem --from-file=./cert.key --from-file=./ca.pem
```
- Deploy the chart with the following parameters:
```
tls.enabled="true"
tls.certificatesSecret="certificates-tls-secret"
tls.certFilename="cert.pem"
tls.certKeyFilename="cert.key"
tls.certCAFilename="ca.pem"
```

### %%OTHER_SECTIONS%%

## Persistence

The [Bitnami %%CHART_NAME%%](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/%%CHART_NAME%%) image stores the %%CHART_NAME%% data and configurations at the `/bitnami` path of the container. Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments.

### Additional environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
%%CHART_NAME%%:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars and Init Containers

If additional containers are needed in the same pod (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `sidecars` parameter. Here is an example:

```yaml
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
    containerPort: 1234
```

If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the `service.extraPorts` parameter (where available), as shown in the example below:

```yaml
service:
...
  extraPorts:
  - name: extraPort
    port: 11311
    targetPort: 11311
```

If additional init containers are needed in the same pod, they can be defined using the `initContainers` parameter. Here is an example:

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Learn more about [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/).

### Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `*.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `*.podAffinityPreset`, `*.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `*.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, due to unexpected issues, installations can become corrupted and get stuck in a *CrashLoopBackOff* restart loop. In these situations, it may be necessary to access the containers and perform manual operations to troubleshoot and fix the issues. To ease this task, the chart has a "Diagnostic mode" that will deploy all the containers with all probes and lifecycle hooks disabled. In addition to this, it will override all commands and arguments with `sleep infinity`.

To activate the "Diagnostic mode", upgrade the release with the following comman. Replace the `MY-RELEASE` placeholder with the release name:
```console
$ helm upgrade MY-RELEASE --set diagnosticMode.enabled=true
```
It is also possible to change the default `sleep infinity` command by setting the `diagnosticMode.command` and `diagnosticMode.args` values.

Once the chart has been deployed in "Diagnostic mode", access the containers by executing the following command and replacing the `MY-CONTAINER` placeholder with the container name:
```console
$ kubectl exec -ti MY-CONTAINER -- bash
```
